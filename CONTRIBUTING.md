# Contributing to the help pages

The LibreCores help pages are hosted in a separate repository to make
it easier for contributors to update the pages and check them locally.

The pages are built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and accept
standard Markdown. See the [README](README.md).

Push your changes to your private fork and open a pull request to
suggest changes or fixes.
